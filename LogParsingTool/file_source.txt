# This is a tool built in python but converted to exe file with Pyinstaller package.  
# This is the file where you configure the path variable created in the script. 
# You can add the path to a log file to this file, a folder including log files, or a bar package with log files or folders with log files inwards to this file directly. 
# You can add as many path to this file as you want, and no need to change the name of "path", which means you can add "path=C:\tmp\file.log" and "path=D:\tmp\innerTmp\file2.log" both to this file. But each path should lie in a separate line. 
# In this file, lines starting with "#" means they are comments.

path=C:\usr\tmp\file1.log
path=C:\usr\tmp\file2.log
